# Principled Method for Digital Image Retargeting

Implementation of a principled method for digital image retargeting using the “Patch-Based Bidirectional Similarity” measure. The project includes two parts: the first consists in a method for image retargeting based on a course-to-fine algorithm as proposed by publication Simakov et al. CVPR’08. The second implements search and vote patch operation based on both naive brute force search and “PatchMatch” algorithm, as described in Barnes et al. SIGGGRAPH’09.

In this repository you can find MATLAB files and required C++ resources, for both part 1 and part 2 of the project, along with a **REPORT (_report.pdf_)** that describes in detail the implementation and algorithms used, as well as analysis and conclusions of the experiments carried out using the final solution.
